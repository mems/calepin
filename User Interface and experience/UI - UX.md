> When the point of contact between the product and the people becomes a point of friction, then the industrial designer has failed. On the other hand if people are made safer, more comfortable, more eager to purchase, more efficient – or just plain happier -by contact with the product, then the designer has succeeded.
> — Henry Dreyfuss in Designing for People

> "Done" is not when you ship, but when a person uses it successfully.
> — Adam Silver

> Does the product intuitively help me achieve a task, quickly, when I’m up against a deadline?

## How to ask to rate your app

> No one likes your pop up
> - Don’t interrupt someone’s experience.
> - Don’t ask for an app rating after your app has crashed. That’s just stupid.
> - Do delay asking for a rating until there’s a likely moment of constructive feedback (as you’ll read later), or a positive rating.

### Size of touch screen interactive element

> Apple recommends a minimum target size of 44 pixels wide 44 pixels tall. Since physical pixel size can vary by screen density, Apple’s pixel specifications apply best to the iPhone’s 320 by 480 pixel, 3.5 inch display.
> Google has following recommendations for touch targets — they should be at least 48 x 48dp. In most cases, they should be separated by 8dp of space or more to ensure balanced information density and usability. A touch target of 48 x 48dp results in a physical size of about 9mm, regardless of screen size. Touch targets include the area that responds to user input. Touch targets extend beyond the visual bounds of an element: an element like an icon may appear to be 24 x 24dp but the padding surrounding it comprises the full 48 x 48dp touch target.
> Sufficient spacing between touch targets. The main reason to have a minimum distance between touch targets is to prevent users from touching and invoking the incorrect action. This becomes extremely important in scenarios where you have icons like “Save” and “Cancel” right next to each other. Using at least 2 mm of padding between targets is extremely important in this case.

## Carousel / slideshow

Aka carrousel (FR)

> You might want to use a slideshow for a gallery of photographs or a presentation perhaps. Maybe a step by step. In the right circumstance it makes a lot of sense.

Alternative Idea: Complex Grids
> Scrolling has become a dominant feature of website navigation, especially on mobile where to click/tap interactions aren’t as reliable. Grids allow the user to scroll and scan through content quickly while being subjected to a mixture of text and images. Our brains tend to feel more familiar with this type of concept because we navigate our social media feeds in the same way.

## E-commerce

- [UX Research: 3 Key Design Principles for Product Listing Information - Articles - Baymard Institute](https://baymard.com/blog/list-item-design-ecommerce)

### Use product filters instead of categories

Categories are mutually exclusive (cannot be combined)

- [Over-Categorization: Avoid Implementing Product Types as Categories (56% Get it Wrong) - Articles - Baymard Institute](http://baymard.com/blog/ecommerce-over-categorization)

### Pricing plans

1. Highlight a recommended option
2. Allow users to switch currency (€/$/£)
3. Allow users to switch pricing monthly/yearly
4. Keep the entire pricing plan area clickable
5. Use slider to calculate how much a user would save
6. Provide free first month for good engagement
7. Prominently highlight testimonials prominently
8. Repeating call to action on top and bottom
9. Sell benefits instead of features
10. Indicate that users can cancel any time
11. Indicate what group each pricing plan is for (e.g. freelancers)
12. Avoid mentioning “account” anywhere (nobody *wants* to create an account)
13. On mobile, turn pricing plans into accordions (e.g. Slack)
14. Small commitments are better than big ones
15. Allow users to switch table/slider views
16. Highlight selected/tapped row/column in a table
17. On mobile, keep the pricing and figures as a fixed bar
18. Allow users to select features of interest
19. Allow users to configure their own pricing plan
20. Allow users to compare all features in a full screen mode
21. Potentially use tabs at the top/bottom for comparison
22. Make sure each section drops a bit of delight
23. Provide a way out if a user isn’t interested (“buy our books instead”)
24. In a form, display at most 5–6 input fields at a time

- [Pricing Plans Design Checklist](https://gist.github.com/vitalyfriedman/a79d7b72860fbf8d3a12c3aa24af7891)

## Form

Ask wisely the user informations, especially his/her name and address (data format):

- [Forms | CUSU LGBT+](http://www.lgbt.cusu.cam.ac.uk/campaigns/think/forms/)

See also [Person](Person) and [Location (geography)](Location%20%28geography%29)

Advices, see [Design Better Forms](https://medium.com/uxdesign/design-better-forms-96fadca0f49c):

- use one column only
- top align labels
- group labels with their inputs
- avoid all caps label (or any other things)
- show all selection options if under 5. See [Select](#select)
- resist using placeholder text as labels. See [Form labels](#form-labels)
- place checkboxes (and radios) underneath each other for scannability
- make CTAs descriptive. Use "Sign Up" instead of "Submit"
- specify errors inline. "There is already an account with this email" instead of "1 error found"
- use inline validation after the user fills out the field (unless it helps them while in the process).
- don’t hide basic helper text. Explicit show info, don't hide in a tooltip
- differentiate primary from secondary actions. "Sign Up" vs "Cancel"
- ditch the * and denote optional fields. Use "Label - _Optional_" instead of "Label*"
- group related information
- omit optional fields

Input placeholder: instead of `Search` use something like `Search "Austin"` (add search hints). https://twitter.com/lukew/status/798244097265782784

### Don't submit when selection is made

Don't submit when the user use a select or a checkbox/radio, change value in input text, etc.

Input and submission should be separate

### Select

Aka dropdown

It's hard to use the keyboard with it.

Don't use select if you have less than 5 choices or more than 15 choices or choice label is more that 30 chars. Use instead:

- stepper (number input) for small adjustments (like number of passengers for flight booking)
- radio groups or segmented controls for all in one place (like class of travel) or few quantities (filter: any, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+)
- slider for range (like min / max price)
- date input for dates / years
- autocomplete (if too many choices)

If you have too many checkboxes, use a multiple choice select.

**Note: Multiple choice select is not easy to use and users don't know how to select multiple choices in a select.**

- [Why Users Abandon Forms with Select Menus - UX Movement](http://uxmovement.com/forms/why-users-abandon-forms-with-select-menus/)

### Binary choice

Aka checkbox vs radio buttons

- ["Yes or No?" — One Checkbox vs Two Radio Buttons.](https://web.archive.org/web/20201122093811/https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/one-checkbox-or-two-radio-buttons/)

### Checkboxes

If the scenario is “I’m under 18” and “I’m over 18” and you don’t want to set a default to create passive choice:
Use a checkbox “Are you over 18”.
Use case: person should confirm that he or she is 18+ to proceed to the flow

### Form validation

> Don’t disable buttons. If a user makes a mistake it won’t be clear what they’ve done wrong.
>
> Always let users click the button, and show an error message if you need to.
> - [Adam Silver on Twitter: "Don’t disable buttons…" https://t.co/i5nU1LbU1o"](https://twitter.com/adambsilver/status/1170954800374173696?s=12)

**Avoid message under fields.** See [Avoid Messages Under Fields | Adrian Roselli](http://adrianroselli.com/2017/01/avoid-messages-under-fields.html)

Show validation error(s) only after the user enter input (after focus blur), update it then remove it when the error(s) is fixed:

> …give users a fair chance to enter a valid input before showing an error message (a conclusion we can often only draw once the user leaves the field), yet that same error message must be updated and removed instantly upon the user fixing their input (i.e. at each and every keystroke).
– [Usability Testing of Inline Form Validation: 40% Don't Have It, 20% Get It Wrong - Articles - Baymard Institute](https://baymard.com/blog/inline-form-validation#pitfall-1-premature-inline-validation)

> - `onsubmit`, i.e. when the user tries to submit the form.
> - `onblur`, i.e. when the user leaves a form field.
> - `onkeypress`, i.e. whenever the user changes the value of a form field. (And remember this may occur ten or twenty times before the user is done filling out the field.)
> [...]
> show the error messages next to the fields they apply to, and to show them immediately when the user is done filling out the fields. In other words, the onblur timing is best.
> [...]
> users are best served by persistent error messages, i.e. messages that don’t disappear after a while.
> [...]
> error messages should be shown above the form field, and not below, because on a tiny mobile phone screen a message below the field could be covered up by the software keyboard or other UI elements.
> [...]
> The counter-argument is that by now users have grown used to error messages next to or below the form field. Since the screen may not be wide enough, placement next to the field is a big no-no on mobile. Error messages below the form do not have that problem.
> [...]
> So although the error message placement is not entirely clear, the timing has to be onblur, i.e. when the user indicates she’s ready by moving away from a form field. Also, there should be an easy way to add custom error messages to individual form fields.
> [...]
> The user does not need to know about the state of her value every step along the way; one crisp, clear message when she’s finished is quite enough.
> [...]
> Telling the users they’ve made a mistake before they even had a chance to interact with the form is bad UX.

	Humans should fail less than 0.1% on the first attempt.
3. Test should be solvable by humans in less than a several seconds.
4. Test should only be solvable by the human to which it was presented.

## Step progress tracker

- [Progress Trackers in UX Design](http://babich.biz/progress-trackers-in-ux-design/)

## Don't rewrite native logic

**Don't break user habits**

> If you let the browser handle it, the experience will be consistent and familiar to everyone which ever site they visit.

> can introduce more problems than it solves

> false positives and quirky bugs

Reduce learning curve by use common usage the user already know (with her/him tool, platform etc.)

And what about forward compatibility: you ovewrite the current logic not the future one (design or features could change)

### Scroll and zoom

Scroll native behaviors:

- native performances, hardware acceleration:
	iPad Pro get Apple's ProMotion technology: "delivers refresh rates of up to 120Hz for fluid scrolling, greater responsiveness and smoother motion content [...] automatically adjusting the display refresh rate to match the movement of the content."

	- [iPad Pro, in 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch models, introduces the world’s most advanced display and breakthrough performance - Apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/06/ipad-pro-10-5-and-12-9-inch-models-introduces-worlds-most-advanced-display-breakthrough-performance/)
	- [Apple's ProMotion is going to change how we use our devices | iMore](https://www.imore.com/promotion)
- smoothing or not (can be configurable - or not - by the user at OS or browser level) impacted by touch pad for ex.
- out bounce (ex.: iOS)
- (touch) touch to scroll, pinch to zoom
- (iOS) scroll to top by touching the status bar
- (iOS) scroll expand/collapse toolbars (minimal-ui, fullscreen)
- use keys up, down, spacebar, page up, page down, home and end to navigate (scroll) in page
- mouse wheel to scroll (vertical and/or horizontal)
- focus change auto scroll (take account virtual keyboard)
- caret browsing (IE, FF) `F7`
- content selection (text & images) auto scroll
- scrollbar appareance (can not visible on some OS, can be configuratble - or not - by the user at OS level)
- horizontal gesture (touch) or scrolling horizontal (wheel) for change prev/next pages
- scroll bar interaction (often on desktop)
- (Chrome and Safari desktop) search results/markers are shown on scrollbar track
- on OSX click on track will scroll page up/downscroll, but if do it in combination with opt/alt key, will jump to that position, on Windows
- some platform have both up/down scrollbar button grouped
- history (reload, prev/next) autoscroll
- hash/document fragment autoscroll
- (webdev tools) scroll into view (for element)
- native layout: (HTML/CSS) position fixed and sticky, resize/user interaction/change font-size/etc. will auto-reflow
- (if scroll swipe simulated with mouse) select content
- (app specific) pull to refresh (Android, Chrome Android)
- subcontent scroll (html: textarea, iframe, select)

> In Safari, Mail, Contacts, and many other apps, tap the status bar at the top of the screen — which displays the network information, time, and battery level — to scroll quickly to the top.

### Video player

Video player controls:

- space/enter = play/pause
- m = mute/unmute
- up/down arrows = increase/decrease volume

- shift+right/shift+left = faster/slower
- 0-9 = seek to X*10% of duration
- f = enter/exit full screen
- esc = exit fullscreen
- double clicking video turns on fullscreen
- indivdual buttons are keyboard tab-able (uses `<buttons>`)

## Scroll and zoom

> It's not OK to change scroll dynamics, the same way it's not OK to change mouse dynamics.
> – [Scrolljacking is interfacejacking](http://codepen.io/gunderson/pen/GJJPpV)

> Overriding the browser’s default scrolling behavior introduces a whole lot of complexity, and that has implications.

And it's not 100% forward compatible. Native user experience can or native UI change, a new browser version can be broken with this script
