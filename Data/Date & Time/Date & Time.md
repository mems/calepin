The 24-hour format:

- 00:00 (midnight)
- 12:00 (noon)
- 23:59 then 00:00 (midnight, next day)

The 12-hour format (ambiguous midnight and noon):

- 12:00 a.m. (midnight) -> with this order: 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
- 12:00 p.m. (noon) -> with this order: 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
- 11:59 p.m. then 12:00 a.m. (midnight, next day)
