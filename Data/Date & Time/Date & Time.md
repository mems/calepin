The 24-hour format:

- 00:00 (midnight)
- 12:00 (noon)
- 23:59 then 00:00 (midnight, next day)

The 12-hour format (ambiguous midnight and noon):

- 12:00 a.m. (midnight) -> with this order: 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
- 12:00 p.m. (noon) -> with this order: 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
- 11:59 p.m. then 12:00 a.m. (midnight, next day)

Due to leap second, it's possible to have 61 seconds or only 59 seconds in 1 minute. `startTime > endTime`. Could use "leap smear" (stretches out the leap second over the course of a day, by effectively adding a couple of microseconds to every second.)

> In the British Empire, it was the only year with 355 days, as 3-13 September were skipped when the Empire adopted the Gregorian calendar.
