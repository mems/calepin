> In the Illusion of Sex, two faces are perceived as male and female. However, both faces are actually versions of the same androgynous face. One face was created by increasing the contrast of the androgynous face, while the other face was created by decreasing the contrast. The face with more contrast is perceived as female, while the face with less contrast is perceived as male. The Illusion of Sex demonstrates that contrast is an important cue for perceiving the sex of a face, with greater contrast appearing feminine, and lesser contrast appearing masculine.

> What you’re looking at isn’t an optical illusion, but is a play on the basic expected traits of men and women’s faces. The flusher lips of the left pic coincide with our expectations for women’s faces, as does the fairer skin. And it’s not just the illusion of lipstick; even without lipstick, we expect women’s lips to be more red than men’s. The difference in skin tone also brings to mind a recent a study suggesting that, on the whole, men’s faces are more red complected, while women’s are more green. Thus, even in the B&W photo, we infer that the darker complected face has the deeper reddish tone of masculinity; the lighter, the paler, greenish tone of femininity.

## Face in human relations

> En fait, il y en a une. Réalisée en 2008 par le [Laboratoire de psychologie des comportements et des mobilités](http://www.inrets.fr/linstitut/unites-de-recherche-unites-de-service/lpc/), elle visait à comprendre pourquoi notre comportement change une fois installé dans l’habitacle d’une voiture. Tout simplement parce qu’il est, déjà, plus difficile de voir le visage des autres conducteurs. «Or, l’échange visuel est un élément pacifiant des relations humaines», note [Nicolas Guéguen, chercheur en psychologie sociale](http://nicolas.gueguen.free.fr/).
