To clean:

1. Remove dirt with salt (or the scrub part of a sponge or chainmail scrubber, act as abrasive) with sponge (**don't use soap**)
2. Clean with clear water
3. Remove excess water (heat the pan)
4. put oil with tissue every where in
5. stop heating when it's start smoking

Seasoning:

1. Clean with soap and water
2. Remove excess water (heat the pan)
3. put in oven (230°C for an hour)
4. use cooking oil every where (remove excess oil)

> Seasoning is a dynamic process. Some of your cooking will add seasoning, some will remove it. If you follow this quick guide after every use, you will be on your way to seasoning glory.
> 
> While getting this pan up to speed, be generous with your cooking oils and fats. Many performance issues can be traced back to using too little fat. Before cooking, heat the pan up gradually with low to medium heat (5-10 mins) and try not to exceed the smoke point of your cooking oil.
> 
> Acidic foods are rough on seasoning, for example: tomatoes, lemons, wine, vinegars. It’s going to be a while before you’ve built up enough seasoning for these foods. We encourage you to be patient, but we also encourage you to be brave and not baby your skillet.
> 
> Boiling water, especially with salt, is rough on seasoning.
> 
> 1. Scrubgently with warm water (optional: mild dish soap)
> 2. Towel dry
> 3. Heat on stovetop until remaining water evaporates
> 4. Rub a very thin layer of oil or fat on the interior and exterior of the pan. We prefer saturated fats because they’re more stable at room temperature. Coconut oil is one of our favorites, but the stories from your grandparents about the benefits of lard and cast iron are rooted in truth
