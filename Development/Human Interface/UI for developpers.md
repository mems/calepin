## Notebook

Aka document code

- Jupyter Notebook (IPython Notebook) .ipynb
- Literate CoffeeScript .litcoffee .coffee.md

two-column [Docco](http://ashkenas.com/docco/)

## Outline

Also called Document map.

Outline important elements like :

- pages
- sections and sub-sections
- titles and sub-titles
- Objects : packages, classes, methods, properties, etc.

## Minimap

Graphical dezomed view of document like navigator panel in Photoshop

## Code hightlighting

Aka syntax hightlighting

- [Syntax highlighting is a waste of an information channel ‚Ä¢ Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/syntax-highlighting-is-a-waste-of-an-information/)

## Code flow

Save all calls, contexts (like closures), parameters, time, duration

## Code reload

- live reloading: reload completely, loose the app state
- hot reloading: reload partial parts, but keep current app state

Works easily for [declarative code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming). It's more complicated for [imperative code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) (or [procedural code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)), where the code controle the app state with control flow

> Declarative programming contrasts with imperative and procedural programming. Declarative programming is a non-imperative style of programming in which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed
