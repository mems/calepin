## Development skill

1. can I do this?
2. can I do this more easily?
3. can I do this more elegantly?
4. can I not do this?

## Reasons why code breaks

> QA Engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a sfdeljknesv.

- code is untested: back your code with **automated tests**!
- code does not report errors: use **exception reporting** mechanisms like services that collect live crash reports
- code remains isolated too long: integrate often! Make **continuous integration** part of your development workflow.
- code is developed in isolation: consider **pair programming** and/or regular **code reviews** to share "code ownership".
- code solves problems that aren't there: make sure you **don't overengineer**. Keep things as simple as possible.
- code reinvents the wheel: keep your eyes open for good **third-party libraries** that have stood the test in other projects already.
- code depends on too many external pieces: use **third-party libraries** only when you're convinced that they are of high quality - and you really need them.
- code is not actively maintained: schedule time for regular **refactorings**.

> Arriving at stable, secure code is mostly a question of discipline. Professional tools and workflows can help a lot in avoiding the most common problems (and catastrophes).

## Logging

Syslog Severity Levels (importance or severity, from high to low):

- emergency (0) aka panic, emerg: "Your application is completely broken. If you sleep, you must wake up and begin to repair your application.". Ex: crashes, stopped processes
- alert (1): "Your application does not work. If you going to go to bed, you should not do it, you must begin to repair your application.". Ex: platform errors
- critical (2) aka crit: "Your application is running, but can be broken soon. If you eat, you should do it quickly and begin to repair your application.". Ex: hardware issues, port security, STP
- error (3), aka err: "Your application is running, but something bad happened. You must add the task "fix the bug" to your to-do list.". Ex: ACL issues, TCAM issues, PAgP problems, ethernet controller, interface up/down
- warning (4), aka warn: "Your application is running, but soon you may see error messages. You should add the task "fix the bug" to your to-do list.". Ex: DHCP snooping
- notifications (5) aka notice: "Your application is running, but something unusual happened. You have to think about it in your spare time.". Ex: 802.1X, DTP, EtherChannel, inline power, STP, interface line protocol
- information (6), aka info: "Your application works fine. These messages show how well.". Ex: stack events, port security, dynamic ARP inspection, VTP, UDLD, STP, hardware diagnostics
- debug (7): "You can use it during development. And do not use in production environment.". Ex: debug output

Note: Unless compliance demands it, levels 5, 6 and 7 are not required and will consume unnecessary resources.

## Refactoring

Monolith to separate modules / files.

> [about dependency graph like circular dependencies] We can make arrows point in different directions, by either moving responsibilities into the component that depends on them or applying inversion of control. Inversion of control means to invert a dependency in such a way that control flow and source code dependency are opposed. This can be done for example through a publish/subscribe mechanism

Often due to [complexity](#complexity) or [misconceptions and falsehoods](#falsehoods)

> Apparently, when they didn't have the right data for a vehicle, a privately operated citation processing center used the word NULL in the license plate field for many tickets. Since that just happens to be Droogie's license plate, he got all of them.
> Droogie contacted the DMV who told him to change his plate. He refused because he didn't do anything wrong. While they wiped the fines off his record, unfortunately for him, they didn't fix the problem in the system so once again, Droogie has accrued another $6,000 in tickets that he had nothing to do with. He says he won't be paying those either.

> Local variables
>
> Keep them short; long names obscure what the code does.
>
> Common variable/type combinations may use really short names:
> Prefer i to index.
> Prefer r to reader.
> Prefer b to buffer.
> Avoid redundant names, given their context:
>
> Prefer count to runeCount inside a function named RuneCount.
> Prefer ok to keyInMap in the statement
> [...]
> Longer names may help in long functions, or functions with many local variables.
> (But often this just means you should refactor.)

### Inclusive terminology

> For symbol names and documentation, avoid introducing new usage of "master" / "slave" (or "slave" independent of "master") and "blacklist" / "whitelist".
>
> Recommended replacements for "master" / "slave" are:
>
> - "primary", "main" / "secondary", "replica", "subordinate"
> - "initiator", "requester" / "target", "responder"
> - "controller", "host" / "device", "worker", "proxy"
> - "leader" / "follower"
> - "director" / "performer"
>
> Recommended replacements for "blacklist" / "whitelist" are:
>
> - "denylist" / "allowlist"
> - "blocklist" / "passlist"
>
> Exceptions for introducing new usage is to maintain a userspace ABI/API, or when updating code for an existing (as of 2020) hardware or protocol specification that mandates those terms. For new specifications translate specification usage of the terminology to the kernel coding standard where possible.

Use more appropriate terms. Exemple, instead of "master and slave", use "primary and secondary" or "initiator and responder" (based on the context). For "whitelist and blacklist", use "safelist" and "blocklist".

### Comments

> TOneverDO

> Code can describe how, but it cannot explain why

> Clarify what's not typically legible by humans

> Comments can be like a chapter of a book [sections for people to find they way more quickly]
> [...]
> This is ok to refactor [about a comment that describe a part of code that is not well written, because it's temporary or for any understandable reason]
>
> — [The Art of Code Comments - Sarah Drasner | JSConf Hawaii 2020 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhF7OmuIILc)

> I’ve found that adding TODO comments that are associated with Jira tickets flagged as “tech debt” is a good way to get a handle on that urge. It doesn’t take long for an entire backlog to fill up with such tickets and then you have a visible / accountable way to approach them.

> — [Dave Sag on Twitter: "@laurieontech I’ve found that adding TODO comments that are associated with Jira tickets flagged as “tech debt” is a good way to get a handle on that urge.

Can be used to descript the purpose of specific regexp or usage of unexpected API/syntax (for bugs workaround or undocumented features need to be used)

But add comment that is not well maintained is "bad documentation can be worst than no documentation". The comment is part of the code and maintenance too.

> The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourselves in code.
>
> — Robert C. Martin

> Every comment represents a failure to make the code self explanatory
>
> — Robert C. Martin

```js
// Check to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits
if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) && (employee.age > 65)) {
	…
}
// vs
if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits()) {
	…
}
```


```js
// from https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/1308654845432340480/photo/1
// Descriptive variable names:
const height = 1;// Height in pixels
// vs
const heightInPixels = 1;

// Extracting logic into methods:
// Calculate total area
for(const size of sizes){/**/}
// vs
calculateTotalArea(sizes);

// Adding extra checks in case of assumptions:
// Height should always be greater that zero
return width / height;
// vs
console.assert(height > 0);
return width / height;
```


> Much of the time, a comment can be improved by deleting it and encapsulating meaning in well-named functions or variables

Comments should complement the code. Maybe add notes on how to test, where the stubs are, dependencies...tacit knowledge beyond the code

> Code comments document the why, not the how
> [...]
> Documentation is for every possible user

## Version control system

Aka VCS

See also [Git](./Git/Git.md)

### Store only sources without configuration

**Don't store configuration files, especially if contains password, private keys, etc.** Ignore configuration files, but provide an configuration example file

**Store only sources**, nothing else can be computed / recreated. If you need it, use submodules or a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager).
Store only data is part of the software. If it's content like blog content (mysql dump) store it with an other way or with a submodule.
The question is: the resource that belong to the project or are projects them-selves? Store it in the same VCS or as dependency (submodule) or with another solution (like SQL dump)

Ex: App Code + precompiled lib/binaries submodule (will be used to include thrid party code)

If images are part of the software:
App Code + (exported) PNGs or AppCode + design (PSD) submodule (will be used to generate icons automatically, etc.)

### Version message

Aka Git commit message.

See [Version message](../Development/Git/Git.md#version-message)

## Indentation

Aka tabs vs spaces, spaces vs tabs

- (accessibility) people can set the indentation render size (aka tab-width) to whatever they prefer in a way that doesn't affect other users (2-space indentation can be hard to read)
- it's faster to move around only using the keyboard (IDE can handle that)
- most IDE can swith/convert one to the other
- tab is a character specifically meant for indentation (in fact they are meant for tabulation)
- it's impossible to half-indent something with tabs
- store a tab char use less space than spaces
- alignement (with spaces) don't survive an automated refactor
- tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment:

    ```
	[tab]void someNiceMethod(
	[tab][space*20]int arg1
	[tab])
    ```

	Or allow only simplier indentation:

    ```
	[tab]void someNiceMethod(
	[tab][tab]int arg1
	[tab])
    ```

## Release note

See [Release note](../Documentation/Documentation.md#release-note)

## Game development

Aka game dev

- Use a framerate, and compute all physics on that in each frames, compute the number of frames must be computed with the delta time or within a loop (for replay, as anti-cheat method)
- store all account activity (connections, change status/state, name, email, password, login, logout, rights, game start, game end, etc.)
- separate user account and user logins (email, native, OAuth, etc.)
- clients don't always have the right time (time offset of few seconds/minutes)

Anticheat:

- use a replay engine (simulation)
- save IP, device type, connection type, client revision/version, server revision/version, etc.
- save input and output (see below)
- use a seed (a PRNG) for random, you could use it for only short timelapse the client need to retrive at defined delay (ex: each 10 seconds need to get a new seed from the server). If in the timeframe the client can't get the new seed, it's a asychronous issue. The player is disconnected (the game end) or the game paused until the seed is retrived.
	Or use server side event to be sure the server control randomness continuously

For replay, be sure:

- your engine should use fixed framerate
- nothing should be based on time, but on frames (store results in engine frames, not time units)
- be sure sorted items are stable (what happend when 2 elements have the same compared value)
- consider all external values that could modify states
- record input and all values (objects position, states)

```

```php
$aMembers = $this->m_pMembers
	->join('jobs')
	->join('orders')

### Method cascades

Supported in Dart language via `..`

```dart
displayObject = new DisplayObject();
..x = 10;
..y = 20;
..alpha = 0.5;
..rotation = 180;
```

Vs.

```as3
displayObject = new DisplayObject();
displayObject.x = 10;
displayObject.y = 20;
displayObject.alpha = 0.5;
displayObject.rotation = 180;
```

### Goto

Some languages don't have goto keyword, but a loop with conditional (switch or if-else) can be used.

//eq.
object.function(param1);
//eq.
bindedFunction.call(object, param1);

## Sub-language/template

String data could contains injection points or processing instructions

- PHP can contains part of HTML (specialy outside processing instruction, inside strings / HEREDOC)
- HTML can contains CSS (in `style` tags) or JavaScript (inside `script` tags) or any other language like human language (en, fr, etc. in any tag) or machine language (inside `pre`, `code`, `script` tags)
- PHP can contains SQL (inside strings / HEREDOC)
- JavaScript can contains HTML or CSS (inside strings)
- HTML can contains JS or CSS

## Tests

> Tests are a specification
> The most important role of unit tests in your code is to provide an executable specification of what the code is supposed to do. Even if the test code is wrong, or the code has bugs, the knowledge of what the system is supposed to do is priceless.

> Unit testing forces you to feel the pain of bad design up front
>
> — Michael Feathers

> Good unit tests share a lot of the following characteristics:
>
> - Fast - should run in milliseconds.
> - No network access - should be able to turn off wireless/unplug and all the tests still pass.
> - Limited file system access - this adds to speed and flexibility if deploying code to other environments.
> - No database access - avoids costly setup and teardown activities.
> - Test only one thing at a time - a unit test should have only one reason to fail.
> - Well-named - see 5.2 above.
> - Mostly fake objects - the only "real" objects in unit tests should be the object we're testing and simple value objects. The rest should be some form of test double

> If a class is hard to test, it's a design flaw. Different flaws manifest themselves in different ways, though. If you have to do a ton of mocking, your class probably has too many dependencies, or your methods are doing too much.

  internal class Program

Or simply:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace CommandPattern
{
  public static class Program
  {
    private static readonly Dictionary Commands =
      new Dictionary
      {
        { "ON", () => Console.WriteLine("The light is on") },
        { "OFF", () => Console.WriteLine("The light is off") }
      };

    private static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      if (args.Length == 1 && Commands.ContainsKey(args[0]))
      {
        Commands[args[0]]();
      }
      else
      {
        Console.WriteLine("Argument \"ON\" or \"OFF\" is required.");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

Aka paging

- [Pagination - UI - UX](../../User%20Interface%20and%20experience/UI%20-%20UX.md)
- [Pagination — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination)

- page index: 1-based (start at 1)
- page size: 1-based (start at 1)
- total count: `totalRecords`
- total pages: `ceil(totalRecords / pageSize)`, `(totalRecords - 1) / pageSize + 1` or `(totalRecords % pageSize == 0) ? (totalRecords / pageSize) : (totalRecords / pageSize + 1)`
