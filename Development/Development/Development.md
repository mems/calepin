### Numbers every developer should know

Aka speed numbers, latency numbers, delays

> I didn't know what a billion was. I don't think most of those men downtown know what a billion is, either. And if you don't know what a billion is, how on earth do you know what a billionth is?
>
> I fussed and fumed.
>
> Finally one morning, in total desperation, I called over to the engineering building, and said “please cut off a nanosecond and send it over to me”, and I brought you some today.
>
> Now what I wanted when I asked for a nanosecond was, I wanted a piece of wire which would represent the maximum distance that electricity could travel in a billionth of a second.
>
> Of course, it wouldn’t really be through wire. It’d be out in space, velocity of light, so if you start with the velocity of light and use your friendly computer, you’ll discover that a nanosecond is 11.8 inches long. The maximum limiting distance that electricity can travel in a billionth of a second.
>
> Finally, again in about a week I called back and said “I need something to compare this to. Could I please have a microsecond?”
>
> I’ve only got one microsecond, so I can’t give you each one. Here’s a microsecond. Nine hundred and eighty-four feet. I sometimes think we ought to hang one over every programmer’s desk, or around their neck, so they know what they’re throwing away when they throw away microseconds.
>
>
> Now I hope you all get your nanoseconds. They’re absolutely marvellous for explaining to wives and husbands and children, and admirals, and generals, people like that. An admiral wanted to know why it took so damn long to send a message via satellite, and I had to point out that between here and the satellite were a very large number of nanoseconds.
>
> You see, you can explain these things, it’s really very helpful, so be sure to get your nanoseconds.

## Development skill

2. can I do this more easily?
3. can I do this more elegantly?
4. can I not do this?

## Reasons why code breaks

> A QA Engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a sfdeljknesv.
> \[...\] Tries to exit without paying
> First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames, killing everyone.
> The bar was built by ex-Volkswagen engineers and a special case to ensure passing results for sfdeljknesv was hard-coded \[refer to [Volkswagen emissions scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal)\]

- code is untested: back your code with **automated tests**!
- code does not report errors: use **exception reporting** mechanisms like services that collect live crash reports
- code remains isolated too long: integrate often! Make **continuous integration** part of your development workflow.
- code is developed in isolation: consider **pair programming** and/or regular **code reviews** to share "code ownership".
- code solves problems that aren't there: make sure you **don't overengineer**. Keep things as simple as possible.
- code reinvents the wheel: keep your eyes open for good **third-party libraries** that have stood the test in other projects already.
- code depends on too many external pieces: use **third-party libraries** only when you're convinced that they are of high quality - and you really need them.
- code is not actively maintained: schedule time for regular **refactorings**.

> Arriving at stable, secure code is mostly a question of discipline. Professional tools and workflows can help a lot in avoiding the most common problems (and catastrophes).

## Logging

Syslog Severity Levels (importance or severity, from high to low):

- emergency (0) aka panic, emerg: "Your application is completely broken. If you sleep, you must wake up and begin to repair your application.". Ex: crashes, stopped processes
- alert (1): "Your application does not work. If you going to go to bed, you should not do it, you must begin to repair your application.". Ex: platform errors
- critical (2) aka crit: "Your application is running, but can be broken soon. If you eat, you should do it quickly and begin to repair your application.". Ex: hardware issues, port security, STP
- error (3), aka err: "Your application is running, but something bad happened. You must add the task "fix the bug" to your to-do list.". Ex: ACL issues, TCAM issues, PAgP problems, ethernet controller, interface up/down
- warning (4), aka warn: "Your application is running, but soon you may see error messages. You should add the task "fix the bug" to your to-do list.". Ex: DHCP snooping
- notifications (5) aka notice: "Your application is running, but something unusual happened. You have to think about it in your spare time.". Ex: 802.1X, DTP, EtherChannel, inline power, STP, interface line protocol
- information (6), aka info: "Your application works fine. These messages show how well.". Ex: stack events, port security, dynamic ARP inspection, VTP, UDLD, STP, hardware diagnostics
- debug (7): "You can use it during development. And do not use in production environment.". Ex: debug output

Note: Unless compliance demands it, levels 5, 6 and 7 are not required and will consume unnecessary resources.

## Refactoring

Monolith to separate modules / files.

> [about dependency graph like circular dependencies] We can make arrows point in different directions, by either moving responsibilities into the component that depends on them or applying inversion of control. Inversion of control means to invert a dependency in such a way that control flow and source code dependency are opposed. This can be done for example through a publish/subscribe mechanism

> Apparently, when they didn't have the right data for a vehicle, a privately operated citation processing center used the word NULL in the license plate field for many tickets. Since that just happens to be Droogie's license plate, he got all of them.
> Droogie contacted the DMV who told him to change his plate. He refused because he didn't do anything wrong. While they wiped the fines off his record, unfortunately for him, they didn't fix the problem in the system so once again, Droogie has accrued another $6,000 in tickets that he had nothing to do with. He says he won't be paying those either.

## Naming

Aka naming things, few words

- avoid noise words: The (prefix), info, data, variable, object, manager, interface, (type: string, array, list, boolean, etc.). Ex: `UserInfo` to `User`, `BookData` to `Book`
- use pronounceable names: `yyyymmdstr` vs `currentDate`
- be consistent, ex: do not use _fetch_, _retrieve_, and _get_ for the same operation in different classes
- use intention revealing names, ex: `const rf = 5000; //the rental fee paid by the tenant` vs `const rentalFee = 5000;`. "The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name is not intention revealing.". See also [Principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)
- don’t append type information, ex: `const firstNameString;` vs `const firstName;`
- replace magic numbers with named constants, ex: `const totalLoanDays = gracePeriod + 7;` vs `const NUMBER_OF_DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7; const totalLoanDays = gracePeriod + NUMBER_OF_DAYS_IN_WEEK;`
- use pronounceable and searchable names, ex: `Date modymdhms;` vs `Date modificationTimestamp;`
- methods/functions should have verb or verb phrase names, ex: `deleteApplication`, `createUser`

> - "director" / "performer"
>
> Recommended replacements for "blacklist" / "whitelist" are:
>
> - "denylist" / "allowlist"
> - "blocklist" / "passlist"

About choice to microservices vs monolith (or in between)

> I'm convinced that one of the biggest architectural mistakes of the past decade was going full microservice
>
> On a spectrum of monolith to microservices, I suggest the following:
>
> Monolith > apps > services > microservices
>
> So, some thoughts
>
> First, these are thoughts, not rules. Anyone that has built a large distributed system knows they don't really work that way and have to adapt with it
>
> Second, stage will be important. If you are reading this at a 5-50 person company...just stick with a monolith. Trust me
>
> If you are reading this at a 10k person company, likely have all of these to some degree but here is where my quick thoughts might differ from what has been done in the past
>
> Now, diversion. Let's talk definitions. There exist no exact definitions for these all
>
> So instead of bike shedding over definitions, I typically just think of it this way
>
> - monolith - http://xyz.com
> - apps - http://abc.xyz.com, major things of value or value creation, possible core proposition, limited to a few apps
> - services - supporting apps/monoliths, core infra pieces, needed by lots of surface area, core compliance func, possibly not written by app teams (infra maintains them)
> - microservices - few hundred lines of code, mostly one-offs, likely could/should be library or SDK
>
> Ok, with all that out of the way, let's talk why
>
> My thinking basically goes like this
>
> Speed & risk
>
> 1. It's generally easier for entire engineering teams to work inside one big app (think entire site in Rails app) than to reason about the ways in which microservices will fail
> 2. distributed systems, which you will have as you grow no matter what, are hard enough to reason about with introducing dozens let alone hundreds of microservices that have their own risk profiles
> 3. as you go fully micro, you need to introduce new concepts to handle the sprawl
> 4. A big one. Each bespoke infra service or microservice is an extreme version of debt IMV. Code is debt, but services are extreme versions of that. Really think about about what that means for you. Prefer your debt to be literal points of highest leverage not nice to haves
>
> I think a challenge we dist systems engineers have is we really like to not have duplication so we see something being done in a few places and think "let's just pull this out and make a microservice out of it".
>
> In theory this is fine. And if done for a few tens of instances, it is fine. When it goes to several dozen microservices or...way worse...across massive company boundaries (think one color service for all of Microsoft/Google/Apple) it becomes less technical and more org challenge
>
> And I know what I'm presenting so many feels like some false dichotomies but in practice I find there are definite tech challenges with microservices, but there are even more org challenges with them
>
> And of all the things I worry about it's this
>
> First, infra (unless company is led by unusually with-it CEO) almost always gets short end of priority stick
>
> Second, too many services typically leads to a lack of ownership problem and boundary issues
>
> Third, you introduce even more tooling to deal with too many microservices
>
> And most importantly, each microservice that could/should have been a library or sdk or something introduces production risk
>
> more code is indeed overhead, more services is customer facing prod/experience risk. Both approaches have overhead/risk but the % distribution is diff
>
> So this is typically what I recommend
>
> 1. Be a monolith as long as possible
> 2. Services start in infra for infra reasons, not app eng typically
> 3. If breaking out mono, break to large apps, not small services
> 4. Think that each new app is a virtual wall in your company
> 5. Prefer libraries to microservices where possible
>
> The classic "we introduced a color service" is my favorite extreme example of where I would choose a library over a service. Yes extreme example but hey, it gets very talked about as quintessential example
>
> "But Jason, what about Amazon and Uber and ..?"
>
> 1. Hey, you do you. I'm just saying what I've gone through in experience
> 2. If you have the success of Amazon when that mandate came down for services, go nuts
> 3. These are more guidelines than rules
>
> 90% of all companies in the world could probably just be a monolith running against a primary db cluster with db backups, some caches and proxies and be done with it
>
> For the 10% of companies that hit planet scale (no pun intended here Sam) it's gonna be art figuring this out
>
> Distributed systems combined with scaling companies is so complex and so few people have done it that it's hard to draw specific lessons from those companies. Each context and instance is different. What I'm talking about here is more thoughts on how to approach the problems
>
> And going back to this
>
> Monolith > apps > services > microservices
>
> It's basically an approach to scale: be one big thing for as long as possible. Never overcorrect to too small of things, go through it as you grow (even hyper growth). This is for org and tech
>
> Again, it's art

- if a function has too many arguments it is either doing to many things or there is an encapsulation missing (extract the arguments into an object as the argument)
- do one thing
- avoid side effects, ex: a `readFile()` function that reads the content of a file shouldn't deletes that file without notifying the user
- remove dead code; a `checkPassword()` function that checking the password, but when the password is valid, it is also initializing the session which is a side-effect, or rename it as `checkPasswordAndInitializeSession()`
- command query separation: a function should either ask something or do something, but not both
- remove duplicate code (but it's could be OK do have duplicate code, when portion are small)
- know your language's conventions, ex: `camelCase` in Java but `snake_case` in Python (see [Naming convention](#naming-convention)), opening braces on a new line in C# but put them on the same line in Java and JavaScript

Can be used to descript the purpose of specific regexp or usage of unexpected API/syntax (for bugs workaround or undocumented features need to be used)

But add comment that is not well maintained is "bad documentation can be worst than no documentation". The comment is part of the code and maintenance too.

```js
// Check to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits
if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) && (employee.age > 65)) {
	…
}
// vs
if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits()) {
	…
}
```


```js
// from https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/1308654845432340480/photo/1
// Descriptive variable names:
const height = 1;// Height in pixels
// vs
const heightInPixels = 1;

// Extracting logic into methods:
// Calculate total area
for(const size of sizes){/**/}
// vs
calculateTotalArea(sizes);

// Adding extra checks in case of assumptions:
// Height should always be greater that zero
return width / height;
// vs
console.assert(height > 0);
return width / height;
```


> Much of the time, a comment can be improved by deleting it and encapsulating meaning in well-named functions or variables

Comments should complement the code. Maybe add notes on how to test, where the stubs are, dependencies...tacit knowledge beyond the code

## Lifecycle

- CI/CD
- [CI/CD - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)

## Source code organisation

```
/build (bin|export|dist) - a (pre-)compiled version of your library/app
/docs (documentation) - possibly in .md .html or .txt so no compiling is needed in order to read them
	/{ISO 639-1 code} - if localized docs
/examples - demos of your library or sample files
/src (sources)
	/data (assets|resources|res) - assets you need
	/libs (vendor|libraries) - libraries you depend on
	/in as many folders as needed - your own code
	main entry file (e.g. main.cpp, index.html)
/tests - unit tests
/utils - utilities for building and stuff
LICENSE
README
.gitignore (or similar)
```

## Version control system

Aka VCS

See also [Git](./Git/Git.md)

### Store only sources without configuration

**Don't store configuration files, especially if contains password, private keys, etc.** Ignore configuration files, but provide an configuration example file

**Store only sources**, nothing else can be computed / recreated. If you need it, use submodules or a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager).
Store only data is part of the software. If it's content like blog content (mysql dump) store it with an other way or with a submodule.
The question is: the resource that belong to the project or are projects them-selves? Store it in the same VCS or as dependency (submodule) or with another solution (like SQL dump)

Ex: App Code + precompiled lib/binaries submodule (will be used to include thrid party code)

If images are part of the software:
App Code + (exported) PNGs or AppCode + design (PSD) submodule (will be used to generate icons automatically, etc.)

### Version message

Aka Git commit message.

Use the imperative mood in the subject line: "if applied, this commit will _imperative sentence_", that match Git's own language pattern.

One commit doesn't necessarily mean a feature change, there could be multiple atomic commits that form part of one feature change. Use PR titles to describe feature changes. The changelog could be essentially a list of PR titles.

## Indentation

Aka tabs vs spaces, spaces vs tabs

- (accessibility) people can set the indentation render size (aka tab-width) to whatever they prefer in a way that doesn't affect other users (2-space indentation can be hard to read)
- it's faster to move around only using the keyboard (IDE can handle that)
- most IDE can swith/convert one to the other
- tab is a character specifically meant for indentation (in fact they are meant for tabulation)
- it's impossible to half-indent something with tabs
- store a tab char use less space than spaces
- alignement (with spaces) don't survive an automated refactor
- tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment:

    ```
	[tab]void someNiceMethod(
	[tab][space*20]int arg1
	[tab])
    ```

	Or allow only simplier indentation:

    ```
	[tab]void someNiceMethod(
	[tab][tab]int arg1
	[tab])
    ```

> Tabs, when you want the reader to be in control the layout.
> Spaces, when you want the author be in control the layout.

## Release note

See [Release note](../Documentation/Documentation.md#release-note)

## Game development

Aka game dev

- Use a framerate, and compute all physics on that in each frames, compute the number of frames must be computed with the delta time or within a loop (for replay, as anti-cheat method)
- store all account activity (connections, change status/state, name, email, password, login, logout, rights, game start, game end, etc.)
- separate user account and user logins (email, native, OAuth, etc.)
- clients don't always have the right time (time offset of few seconds/minutes)

Anticheat:

- use a replay engine (simulation)
- save IP, device type, connection type, client revision/version, server revision/version, etc.
- save input and output (see below)
- use a seed (a PRNG) for random, you could use it for only short timelapse the client need to retrive at defined delay (ex: each 10 seconds need to get a new seed from the server). If in the timeframe the client can't get the new seed, it's a asychronous issue. The player is disconnected (the game end) or the game paused until the seed is retrived.
	Or use server side event to be sure the server control randomness continuously

For replay, be sure:

- your engine should use fixed framerate
- nothing should be based on time, but on frames (store results in engine frames, not time units)
- be sure sorted items are stable (what happend when 2 elements have the same compared value)
- consider all external values that could modify states
- record input and all values (objects position, states)

## Programming methods

### Chaining

```js
displayObject.setX(10).setY(20).setAlpha(0.5).setRotation(180);
```

```php
$aMembers = $this->m_pMembers
	->join('jobs')
	->join('orders')
	->fetchAll($szFields, $szConditions);
```

Vs.

```php
$this->m_pMembers->join('jobs');
$this->m_pMembers->join('orders');
$aMembers = $this->m_pMembers->fetchAll($szFields, $szConditions);
```

### Method cascades

Supported in Dart language via `..`

```dart
displayObject = new DisplayObject();
..x = 10;
..y = 20;
..alpha = 0.5;
..rotation = 180;
```

Vs.

```as3
displayObject = new DisplayObject();
displayObject.x = 10;
displayObject.y = 20;
displayObject.alpha = 0.5;
displayObject.rotation = 180;
```

See also [Chaining](#chaining)

### Goto

Some languages don't have goto keyword, but a loop with conditional (switch or if-else) can be used.

- [C JSON parser using a jump table](https://github.com/quartzjer/js0n/blob/master/src/js0n.c)

### Query

Query languages

- E4X: `displayList..(x == 20)`
- SQL
- XPath
- LINQ
- CSS (ex: )

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language
- http://jsonselect.org/#overview

- Callback: `connection.load(callback, errorcallback, params…);`, `var intervalID = setInterval(callback, params…); clearInterval(intervalID);`
- W3C DOM0, Traditional Event Handler: `connection.onload = callback; connection.onerror = errorcallback; connection.load();`
- W3C DOM2 (Observer pattern): `connection.addEventListener("load", callback); connection.addEventListener("error", callback); connection.load()`

- Signal (AS3Signal): https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals
- Other: event SuperClass listener (listen all ErrorEvent), condition event, delayed event (dispatch when a listener is added), first time event listener

### Object and Procedural

```js
object.doSomething(param1);
```

Vs.

```js
function doSomething(object, param1){}
```

In ECMAScript, `function` have context:

```js
const bindedFunction = object.function.bind(object);
bindedFunction(param1);
//eq.
object.function(param1);
//eq.
bindedFunction.call(object, param1);
```

### Blocking, non blocking (usage of events)

## Sub-language/template

String data could contains injection points or processing instructions

- PHP can contains part of HTML (specialy outside processing instruction, inside strings / HEREDOC)
- HTML can contains CSS (in `style` tags) or JavaScript (inside `script` tags) or any other language like human language (en, fr, etc. in any tag) or machine language (inside `pre`, `code`, `script` tags)
- PHP can contains SQL (inside strings / HEREDOC)
- JavaScript can contains HTML or CSS (inside strings)
- HTML can contains JS or CSS

## Tests

> Tests are a specification
> The most important role of unit tests in your code is to provide an executable specification of what the code is supposed to do. Even if the test code is wrong, or the code has bugs, the knowledge of what the system is supposed to do is priceless.

> Unit testing forces you to feel the pain of bad design up front
>
> — Michael Feathers

> Good unit tests share a lot of the following characteristics:
>
> - Fast - should run in milliseconds.
> - No network access - should be able to turn off wireless/unplug and all the tests still pass.
> - Limited file system access - this adds to speed and flexibility if deploying code to other environments.
> - No database access - avoids costly setup and teardown activities.
> - Test only one thing at a time - a unit test should have only one reason to fail.
> - Well-named - see 5.2 above.
> - Mostly fake objects - the only "real" objects in unit tests should be the object we're testing and simple value objects. The rest should be some form of test double

> If a class is hard to test, it's a design flaw. Different flaws manifest themselves in different ways, though. If you have to do a ton of mocking, your class probably has too many dependencies, or your methods are doing too much.

Or simply:

```cs

using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace CommandPattern

      new Dictionary
      {
        { "ON", () => Console.WriteLine("The light is on") },
        { "OFF", () => Console.WriteLine("The light is off") }
      };

    private static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      if (args.Length == 1 && Commands.ContainsKey(args[0]))
      {
        Commands[args[0]]();
      }
      else
      {
        Console.WriteLine("Argument \"ON\" or \"OFF\" is required.");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

Aka paging

- [Pagination - UI - UX](../../User%20Interface%20and%20experience/UI%20-%20UX.md)
- [Pagination — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination)

- page index: 1-based (start at 1)
- page size: 1-based (start at 1)
- total count: `totalRecords`
- total pages: `ceil(totalRecords / pageSize)`, `(totalRecords - 1) / pageSize + 1` or `(totalRecords % pageSize == 0) ? (totalRecords / pageSize) : (totalRecords / pageSize + 1)`
