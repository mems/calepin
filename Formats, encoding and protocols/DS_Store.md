> `.DS_Store` files are only used by the Finder to hold custom view settings for that particular folder

> Finder view settings are stored in invisble `.DS_Store` files, in the **parent** of the folder being set. So the settings for `/Applications` are stored in `/.DS_Store`, and `/Applications/.DS_Store` holds the settings for subfolders of `/Applications`, such as `/Applications/Utilities`.
