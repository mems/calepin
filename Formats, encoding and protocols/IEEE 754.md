Aka IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format (float and double)

Workaround precision: use BigNumber or Unum (universal number)

> we can just use whole integers of cents [...] Division of integers and multiplication by decimals may still result in inexact values, but basic integer addition, subtraction, and multiplication will be accurate.
