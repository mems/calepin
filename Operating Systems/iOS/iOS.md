## Screen mirror

You can use:

- AirPlay
- Quicktime on a connected Mac, see [Record screen](#Screen-record)
- third party app like AirServer or Reflector

## Record phone call

Works better with visual voicemail

Note: voicemail duration could be limited

Use the conference with you voicemail:

1. call your self (you should get your voicemail "leave a message after the bip")
2. call the person
3. merge calls, conversation will be recorded by the voicemail
4. end the call
5. you should now have a new voicemail, with visual voicemail you save it with share button

Or use the speaker an record with an external recorder (or a Mac with QuickTime Player, File > New Audio Recoding, using internal microphone)

It's possible to develop an app that use CallKit to fake a call, and use conference mode?

- If you have an iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4 (GSM), to enable the logging, follow steps 1 and 2 below:

1) Dial: *KOOL*CSI# (*5005*274#) and hit Dismiss button 2) Dial: *KOOL*MA# (*5005*62#)

Once this is done, proceed to step 3 below.

- If you have an iPhone 4 (CDMA), iPhone 4S (GSM/CDMA) or iPhone 5, to enable logging, follow steps 1 and 2 below:

1) Dial: *KOOL*CSI# (*5005*274#) and hit Dismiss button 2) Dial: **KOOL*DIAG# (*5005*3424#) and hit Dismiss button

Once this is done, proceed to step 3 below.

3) Wait a few moments for the command to process. 4) Power off the device by holding down the power button and swiping to turn it off. 5) Power on the device again 6) At this point, CSI and MA or CSI and DIAG logging should be enabled, depending on which device you're using.

- When the issue occurs, follow the steps below to capture the logs:

1) Dial: *KOOL*STATE# (*5005*78283#) 2) Press "Reply" (big green button) 3) Enter a description of the problem 4) Press "Reply" (upper right corner)

Note: The buffer to hold the logs is only 1.5 MB so, make sure to enable logging when you see the issue.

After an iTunes sync to your computer, csi and ma or diag baseband log files should appear in the following locations, depending on what OS you're using:

OS X:

~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/<your device's name here>/Baseband

Use Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) to view this folder and copy the files from there to your desktop like this (replace your device name here with the name of your device in the MobileDevice folder which is unique for each device):

cp -R ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/<your device name here>/Baseband ~/Desktop

Windows 7 and Vista:

C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\Logs\CrashReporter\MobileDevice\<device-name>\Baseband\ Note: The AppData folder is hidden by default. Choose Folder and Search Options from the Organize menu in the file browser window, then click the View tab and change the "Hidden files and folders" option to "Show hidden files and folders".

Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data\Apple Computer\Logs\CrashReporter\MobileDevice\<device-name>\Baseband\ Note: The Application Data folder is hidden by default. Choose Tools > Folder Options in the file browser window, then click the View tab and change the "Hidden files and folders" option to "Show hidden files and folders".

## Simulator

Start the simulator with a specific SDK

```sh
# Xcode changes these paths frequently, so doublecheck them
SDK_DIR="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs"
SIM_APP="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app/Contents/MacOS/Simulator"
$SIM_APP -SimulateApplication $SDK_DIR/iPhoneSimulator8.4.sdk/Applications/MobileSafari.app/MobileSafari
```

- Delete no longer usable devices: `xcrun simctl delete unavailable`
- `xcrun simctl` show help
- list available runtimes (with more infos) `xcrun simctl list runtimes --json`
- open simulator with URL `xcrun simctl openurl booted 'https://example.com'`, `xcrun simctl openurl booted 'myapp://custom'`
- add some medias `xcrun simctl addmedia booted ~/sample-1.jpg ~/sample-2.jpg  ~/sample-3.mp4`
- runtime bundle paths: `/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/*.simruntime` and `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/*.simruntime`

### Start old runtimes

> $ xcrun simctl list
> [...] The iOS 7.1 simulator runtime is not supported after 10.10.5.

To test old runtimes, you need older version of XCode (and Simulator app) (just change the name of `XCode.app`)

- [Why can't I see the iOS 7.0 simulator in Xcode on Yosemite? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26364239/why-cant-i-see-the-ios-7-0-simulator-in-xcode-on-yosemite)
- [More Downloads for Apple Developers](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?name=Xcode)

### Import via Drag & Drop

For images (JPEGs)

1. Drag & Drop image onto simulator
	→ this will open a browser with your image
2. Click & hold image
	→ this will open options
3. Save image
	→ this will copy image onto simulator

Since Xcode 6+, drag & drop immediatly import images (with thumbnails) and open Photo app

For videos

1. Drag & Drop video onto simulator
	→ this will open a browser with your video (autoplay)
2. Click on Done
	→ this will close video (in Safari)
3. Click on Share & Action button (U+4067 of Apple Symbols)
	→ this will open options
4. Click on Save Video
	→ this will copy video onto simulator

### Import via files and folders

1. Add files (`.jpg`, `.m4v`, `.mov`?, `.png`?) in `~/Library/$DATA_PATH/Media/DCIM/100APPLE/`.
2. And delete these files
	```
	~/Library/$DATA_PATH/Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm
	~/Library/Application Support/$DATA_PATH/Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal
	```

	Maybe the folder `PhotoData` can be delete too.

	Where `$IPHONE_SIMULATOR_PATH` is `Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1` (`$VERSION` is `5.1`, `8.3`) or `~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/$DEVICE_UUID/data`
4. Relaunch Simulator

You can also (only for pictures) use `xcrun simctl addphoto`

### Clear devices data

`~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/`

```sh
xcrun simctl delete unavailable
```

### Test application

- [Install App On iOS Simulator | Anexinet](https://www.anexinet.com/blog/install-app-ios-simulator/)

### Create link to iOS Simulator app

Require Xcode installed.

Create a symbolic link :

```sh
cd /Applications/Utilities/
ln -s ../Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app
```

- `../Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone\ Simulator.app iPhone\ Simulator.app`
- http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/Xcode/Conceptual/ios_development_workflow/25-Using_iOS_Simulator/ios_simulator_application.html

### Add to iOS simulator older SDK

Download older version of Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ see also [Xcode - Support - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/)

Since Xcode 5:

Copy

```
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Library/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS 7.1.simruntime
→ /Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS 7.1.simruntime
```

Then, copy

```
Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator7.1.sdk
→ /Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS 7.1.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot
```

But could require to fix simulator runtime:

```sh
sudo mv "/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS 7.1.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/usr/lib/system/host/liblaunch_sim.dylib"{,.bak}
sudo ln -sf "/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/usr/lib/system/host/liblaunch_sim.dylib" "/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS 7.1.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/usr/lib/system/host/liblaunch_sim.dylib"
```

See `~/Library/Logs/CoreSimulator.log`

For older version (but require copy other files):

```
/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS 7.1.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot <=> Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk
```
