**If you local network use the same subnet as remote (through VPN) subnet, you could not reach devices on remote network.** Example: your local netowk use 192.168.1.0/24 subnet and the remote network (through VPN connection) use 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. Change one of network to use an other subnet (ex.: `192.168.2.0/24`).
