To visit a node for a finite tree

 ```json
 [
	{
		"name": "1",
		"childNodes": [
			{
				"name": "1-1",
				"childNodes": [
					{
						"name": "1-1-1",
						"childNodes": []
					}
				]
			},
			{
				"name": "1-2",
				"childNodes": []
			}
		]
	},
	{
		"name": "2",
		"childNodes": []
	}
]
```

Should be easier if node API implement pointers like: childNodes, parentNode, nextSibling, previousSibiling, firstChild, etc.

## Recursive

Call the visitor function itself on all children

Limited by the call stack if no [tail call optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)

	function visitNode(node){
		// Do something with the node
		node.chilren.forEach(visiteNode);
	}

## Stack

Depth-first search like traversal

It support only one root node. It's allow to

Note: `stack` and `indexes` length are not shrinked during loop iteration, because it's not really needed to do so

	// Will gives: "1", "1-1", "1-1-1", "1-2", "2"
	const rootNode = {childNodes:[/*...*/]};
	let deep = 0;// current position in the stack
	let stack = [rootNode];//array of parent nodes
	let indexes = [];// index of the current child in its children list
	// The loop on nodes and their child
	nodes: while(true){
		// visit the node
		let node = stack[deep];
		// do something with the node data or insert, delete children:
		// visitorStart(node, indexes[deep], stack.slice(0, deep - 1), indexes.slice(0, deep - 1));

		// if the node has children, go down visit it
		if(node.childNodes.length){
			deep++;
			indexes[deep] = 0;
			stack[deep] = node.childNodes[0];
			// Continue the loop with the first child node
			continue;
		}

		// Else go visit the next sibling or the parent sibling if any
		// or the grand parent sibling if any, and so on until reach the root node
		while (true){
			// end of node visitation (and its children)
			let parentDeep = deep - 1;// -1 for the root node
			let parents = deep == 0 ? [] : stack.slice(0, parentDeep);
			let childIndexes = deep == 0 ? [] : indexes.slice(0, parentDeep);
			// visitorEnd(stack[deep], indexes[deep], parents, childIndexes);

			// This is the end. The root node don't have siblings
			if(deep === 0){
				break nodes;
			}
			// Continue with the next sibling child
			let siblings = stack[parentDeep].childNodes;
			let nextSiblingIndex = ++indexes[parentDeep];
			// Test if next sibling exist
			if(nextSiblingIndex < siblings.length){
				stack[deep] = siblings[nextSiblingIndex];
				continue nodes;
			}

			// Else no next sibling, go up and try again
			deep--;
		}
	}

	stack.length = indexes.length = 1;// clean up the stack

## Accumulation

Depth-first search like traversal

Will accumulate in a queue node to visit. In the loop, lastest added nodes are visited first. Support multiple root nodes.

Simple, but require more memory than [Stack](#stack), because in each loop iteration the queue is updated (remove the last element and concat new elements). It's store current nodes (but all nodes of the tree) that waiting for visitation. Ex: root node contains 100 children. Each children contains 100 children, which contains 100 nodes each (total 100^100^100). The queue will contains at max 199 nodes.

**This method can't track in the loop iteration the deep in the tree.**

	let queue = [rootNode1, rootNode2/*...*/].reverse();// nodes queue waiting for visitation
	while(queue.length > 0){
		let node = queue.pop();

		// visite the node
		// do something with the node data or insert, delete child

		// Node has children
		if(node.childNodes.length){
			nodes = queue.concat(node.childNodes.slice(0).reverse());// reverse child order to be sure the last is the first visited order
			continue;
		}
	}
